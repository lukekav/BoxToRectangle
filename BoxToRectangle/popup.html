        To use this extension head over to Netflix and select a title
        that you would like to watch. 
        If it is not displayed in 16:9 don't worry, that's what I'm for!
        Press the "Remove Side Bars" button, get comfy and enjoy your show!
        If you would like to change back just hit the restore button and you're done.
        If you would like to remove the blacks bars at the top and bottom of your
        video just press the "Remove Top/Bottoms Bars" button and your done!
